By default, the MR capture can be enabled with the -mixedreality command line parameter when running the game (camera calibration required,
see the “Preparation” section above). This changes the spectator screen of the VR app to display a third-person view of the scene from the
perspective of the calibrated camera present in OVR server. Settings are automatically loaded from the [Oculus.Settings.MixedReality] section
in the Saved/Config/Windows/Engine.ini file.

The composition method is loaded from the Engine.ini file (defaulting to External Composition if nothing is defined), but that can be
overridden on a session-by-session basis with the -externalcomposition or -directcomposition command line params for convenience.
These command line params will not be saved to the config by default.

Examples:

// Launch with settings from Engine.ini
MixedRealitySample.exe -vr -mixedreality
// Launch in external composition mode
MixedRealitySample.exe -vr -mixedreality -externalcomposition
// Launch in direct composition mode
MixedRealitySample.exe -vr -mixedreality -directcomposition

Mixed Reality Capture can also be enabled in the “VR Preview” Play-In-Editor mode by running the editor with the same commands.
